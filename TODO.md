# IN PROGRESS

Tetrahedron
Sequences referenced in oeis gematria - https://oeis.org/A280090
Then tidy up TODO - non-sequence stuff to other package
Star numbers - Unique among the star numbers is 35113, since its prime factors - 13, 37 and 73 - are also consecutive star numbers
Stellated octahedron - massively interesting - see https://oeis.org/A280090
